A game...IN RUBYYYYYY!

This is a game I wrote a bit back, but was originally in python.
I decided to make a ruby version, since I did not see many ruby games.

Pull it from here, cd to correct directory, and run game.rb in ruby.

Mechanics should be straight forward, let me know if not.
DON'T let me know if you have a better way of writing it...
I know this is too simple for some people, but I'm just a plebeian, soooo...

There's a few bugs (and an easter egg) bonus points to anyone that finds them.
No really -- I'll send you a cake.

No cheating by reading the script -- that's lame.

Enjoy.
